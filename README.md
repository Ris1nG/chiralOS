# chiralOS - WORK IN PROGRESS
---
In order to use C in this application, if you want to compile and try on your own
you have to build a cross compiler, i personally used the [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) tutorial in order to achieve that. So to make it compatible with my project you need to use gcc 10.2.0 and binutils 2.35.
